As consumers become more aware of the benefits of lawn aeration—such as improved soil health, enhanced nutrient uptake, and healthier grass—the market has expanded to meet these needs. The rise in landscaping businesses has also bolstered demand for stand-on lawn aerators, as they provide operators with increased mobility, productivity, and comfort compared to traditional walk-behind models.</p><p>In the coming years, the stand-on lawn aerator market is expected to continue its upward trajectory. Analysts project a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7.2% from 2024 to 2032. This substantial growth can be attributed to various factors such as technological advancements in aeration equipment, increased urbanization leading to more landscaped areas, and a growing trend towards sustainable lawn care practices. Additionally, the rise in eco-conscious consumers has prompted manufacturers to develop aerators that promote environmental sustainability, further driving market growth.</p><p>According to industry reports, the global market size for stand-on lawn aerators is estimated to reach \$120 million by 2024. By 2026, this figure is expected to grow to \$145 million, reaching approximately \$180 million by 2030.
